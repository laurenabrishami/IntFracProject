# IntFracProject
The main class is MyForm.cpp. A GUI will be displayed. The user may choose to sort integers, doubles, or-
fractions in ascending or descending order. Commas or whitespace is allowed-
between numbers/fractions, but not both at once. This project uses recursive tree traversal to sort the numbers.
